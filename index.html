                    <p>
                        Born in Bishop, CA to a couple of hippy rock climbers, my childhood was spent exploring the natural world. I have carried
                        my love for the outdoors into my adult life and my passion for adventure is unquenchable. I attended
                        Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff and graduated Suma Cum Laude in 2012. Shortly after graduation,
                        I began my real-world education by travelling to different countries and immersing myself into languages
                        and cultures far different than my own. Not unlike a boomerang, after years flying in my own trajectory,
                        I finally returned home to Arizona. <br> I currently work at Skydive Arizona
                        as a free-fall instructor. I love what I do, and I hope to spend many years teaching students how
                        to stay safe in free-fall. While I am an adventure seeker and an adrenaline junkie, I am also a life-long
                        learner. I am currently taking a full-stack coding course in order to better understand the technology
                        in the world around me. I hope this new knowledge will expose me to new and different opportunities
                        and potentially a new career path.
